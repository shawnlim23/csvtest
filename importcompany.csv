With its 1m_ volume, the BigRep ONE opens the gateway to a new dimension of 3D printing and 3D manufacturing, while the BigRep Studio allows fast and precise large-scale 3D printing.




Engineers, architects and designers now have access to large dimension 3D printing at a much lower price with the ONE and the Studio. 3DÊprinters are constructed to feel at  anywhere, in rugged work environments, such as workshops or construction zones, or in tidy offices or studios.

ÒWe believe it is time to change how we produce things. We want to make the world of manufacturing more individual, creative, and affordableÓ

With BigRep Everything is Possible
From furniture to vehicles to robotics, we think everything is possible. We want you to envision everything from human scale robot parts, sculptural artworks in all their full-dimensional glory, and dream the impossible world-changing designs of tomorrow while enabling you to print them today using one of our 3D printers.
Our growing interdisciplinary team consists of two-third engineers and technical staff. From mechanical engineers to software developers to industrial designers, electronics engineers to chemists and business experts, the whole team is involved in providing advanced large-scale 3D printing experiences.",-,Manufacturer | 3D Printers (>5000$),,AM Hardware,,AM Hardware AM Hardware by Technology Large Format 3D Printer Manufacturer Tech - Industrial FFF/FDM ,bigrep.com/,bigrep.com/,Wohlers Report 2018,-, 3.1-E20,12.1-C121,,,100% FDM | Outreach German,100% FDM | Outreach German; ORID8252,Print Solutions,-,Germany,,Berlin,10961,"Germany, Berlin, Gneisenaustr. 66",,office@bigrep.com,,,,,,Maps,-,,,,,,,,,,,-,,,,,"C Innovation O | Rene Gurka https://www.linkedin.com/in/rene-gurka-647b97/

THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN 2013 AND LAUNCHED ON THE TED STAGE IN 2015, where Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, Dr. Joseph DeSimone, unveiled the scientific breakthrough behind Carbon Digital Light Synthesisª (DLSª) technology for the first time.
Carbon DLS technology fuses light and oxygen to rapidly produce polymer products from a pool of resin. By overcoming limitations of conventional 3D printing, DLS makes it possible to digitally produce parts with unmatched quality and surface finish, and at volumes and speeds never before possible. DLS also empowers designers and engineers to create parts using complex geometries that are impossible to produce using traditional manufacturing methods, opening up new product possibilities. As the worldÕs leading digital manufacturing company, Carbon enables some of the most well-known global brands such as adidas, Riddell, Ford, and Johnson & Johnson to create innovative products with 3D printing technology.
Carbon has customers in 14 countries and is continuing to expand globally in Europe and Asia.
